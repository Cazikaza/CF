# 1. Learning Contract

Knowing that I&#39;m mostly able to prepare a structured and flowing session with a lot of joy and enthusiasm I thought of a way to challenge myself to get most out of this course. My intrest has always been with group dynamics. And with the CF sessions you can really see if a certain method is working for the group or not. This is why I came up with the following.

My learning contract represents the variety of people with which you make up a creative session. And the connections between them.

The old and obsolete: the one stuck in it&#39;s thinking pattern but very reliable and wise through his/her experience.

The silent but hidden gem: the one that is not able to speak up in groups or speaks up less. But when asked to say something he/she can really contribute with a well overthought insight.

The boss: The one with the biggest mouth and a lot of idea&#39;s. But overshadows other team members and can be stuck in a critical mindset.

My goal was to unite these people and make sure that they would all be able to connect and add to the session. Adapting to the personalities of everyone in the room to ensure maximisation of the thinking potential.

My strategy of tackling this goal was to really engage with the people in the room. By making conversation in breaks and during the assignments. And with the information that comes from this conversation adapt the planning to suit the way of collaboration and thinking styles of the participants.

A metaphor that came up during the presentation of the different contracts was the parallel between organising a session and jazz. Everyone should be able to do their own thing and together it sounds as a whole. This has become my vision for my cf sessions. With me as the conductor.

# 3. Internal Session

My Internal session was for Laura Schouwen. Who sought to improve patient handovers at the ICU by design.

## Intake

For the intake we called Laura with a bunch of questions. Which are added in the appendix of the report. These questions gave a good insight on the problem to solve. What had been tried already and most importantly the expected outcome. Which in this case was as many original idea&#39;s as possible that would be used as inspiration for her project. She also provided us with a concise problem definition which proved to be very usefull since all participants had no idea about the context.

## The plan

## Reflection

### Mood

The mood of the group was good. The togetherness of the participants was alright and did certainly improve due to the break activities. I also got the feedback that they really liked my enthusiasm and energy. Resulting in a safe and spontaneous working environment.

### Setting

The chosen setting in the dressing room of the facility was good noise and distraction wise. But it lacked working space and especially important, light.

### Time

I found it difficult to stay on time. Everything felt a bit rushed because of this and because I was feeling behind on time I didn&#39;t alter lower and higher pace activities. This also connected to the time of day and the dim lighting. Causing lower energy.

### Energy

The energy of the group was on the lower side. Which resulted in one of the participants becoming less involved when we were two hours in. I tried to involve this person again and again but it was to late and he was to tired. Later I found that participating in the constant high pace activities and thinking of idea&#39;s was pretty brain frying. So for the next time I would not do a session this late and if I have to would do it in in well lit place altering the pace more and giving more room and time to think. My thought was to keep the energy and pace high to keep people from falling asleep which worked for quite a while but in the end was like trying to do a marathon in sprinting tempo.

### Context

The brief and intake questions proved to be adequate to get everyone on one page with the context. The used visualisation was my favorite part of the session and is something I find quite unique and really helping envisioning who the group is designing for.

### Structure

The structure of the different activities behind each other worked well. There was a real sense of flow from one assignment to the next. Which I was really pleased about. I was however surprised about the time it took to converge after all the idea&#39;s were generated. Making choices for certain idea&#39;s is quite hard especially when you try to conserve the richness of the idea&#39;s. This is something I still need to figure out.

### Group dynamics

There were no authority struggles among them and I had the feeling that I had just enough control over the group. However I could have been a bit too much since I only later heard about the lack of energy.

### Personality

My session triggered the high energy outgoing people well. But is was a bit too much for the less energized. I tried to solve this by using techniques that let people work for themselves which worked to get a bit more out of them but not for to long. I also noticed that these forms of assignments were harder for me to evaluate the mood.

## Concluding

In general I&#39;m really pleased with my first session. It was a good en fun experience and the results were good. I do think that there is room for improvement but this is only logical. I will put more attention to the setting, energy and time constraints of the session to prevent the pitfalls of this session.

# 4. External Session

My external session was for Gerhard Visser head of neurology within epilepsy research centre SEIN.

## Intake

The intake with Gerhard and Hannah consisted of 2 rounds. The first one over the phone explaining the concept of a creative session. And a second one at SEIN by having a conversation with Gerhard and a co-worker(Hannah, Technical medicine) about the possibilities and finding a possible problem to brainstorm on. This went a lot thougher then the previous intake because of the lack of understanding the creative facilitation concept. But with some explanation we came to a resulting question: how can we use a mobile eeg recorder to provide clients with home recording of eeg&#39;s. It helped a lot that I knew what the context was about via my girlfriends graduation project at SEIN.

We also agreed upon a session with a multitude participants of different functions.

## The plan

## Reflection

### Mood

The mood of the group was alright during the session. I quickly noticed that the group was a lot more stiff then a group of IDE students. Which I expected. The best example was one of the participants looking at me with big eyes when I asked everyone to set the tables aside. This stiffness held up through the whole session. In hindsight I could have used some crazy hats or other props to make everyone a bit more loose. In the end the environment I created was just a bit to ordinary.

### Setting

The setting was good, moving the tables over in a conference room worked well to signal that this wasn&#39;t going to be a normal meeting.

### Time

Time was way to tight. I scrapped a lot of my original assignment idea&#39;s in favour of the time and still ended up with too little to really analyse the brought up idea&#39;s in the end.

### Energy

The energy of the group never peaked to extaticness but was overall well managed. I paced certain assignments diffently according to the quality that needed to be produced which worked well.

### Context

This is where the session suffered a big loss. I assumed all participants to be on the same page with the problem statement developed 2 months earlier. Or even expected a further standpoint by now. But the problem statement that was developed was way to far fetched and the first hour was spend on redeveloping what everyone wanted to work towards.

I think this was due to a lack of introduction by the problem owner but also the overestimation of the group&#39;s process by the problem owner. My assumption that everyone was on the same page didn&#39;t help either and we ended up going on to the design phase before the problem was really solidly defined. I could have held an entire session of 3 hours just for finding this problem but didn&#39;t anticipate the importance of this and went on. Leaving the group feeling like they didn&#39;t tackle the right problem at the end of the session.

### Structure

If the problem is not defined clearly in the understanding of the whole group, don&#39;t go on. The session was however a success in finding what the group found important values for an eventual solution for SEIN&#39;s problems. So I&#39;m confident that the structure would have worked well if the problem was better defined. I again heard compliments on the flow of the assignments.

### Group dynamics

Working with medical professionals is a whole different ballgame then working with ID students. I expected a bigger difference in hierarchy and a little less design skills. Which was true but surprising to some extent. The hierarchy was quite alright but still with a boss in a back corner being critical and realistic about everything. The design skills were most surprising. I chose to go for association activities since they seemed most simple to quickly learn. But this was quite hard. I learned that medical professionals are really strong critical thinkers, a pattern that I found hard to reduce completely. Even with all kinds of different stimulus they couldn&#39;t let go off this mindset.

The different professional roles in the group were noticeable. As well as who were friends and not. I could have mixed up the group a bit more to spread the more cheerful people between the people that were unsure of their added benefit to the group. I probably could have solved the problem of the latter with the rest of the group complimenting them on the insights that they could provide in this context.

### Personality

During the session I played around by giving people different stimulus depending on their character. The critical boss got the assignment to come up with idea&#39;s that would be the things that would be the contrary of the ideal solution. The more practical minded nurse required some time to think on his own after all the stimulus of the whole day of work. The more problem solving technical medicine people were mostly triggered by giving them examples of other company&#39;s and finding parallels to the problem they were looking into. This helped them mostly to come up with some extra idea&#39;s whenever they were stuck. The added benefit was that they became amazed by my quickness of coming up with the associations I used as examples. Gaining me some more respect which helped me to steer the group.

## Concluding

Everyone walked away happy but a little unfulfilled. And I would love to do another session with them knowing what I know now. The biggest adjustments would be a more spread out structure that allowed for the development of a strong problem, Idea&#39;s and quality control. Dividing them in three sessions. I am pleased to notice that the problems of the first session didn&#39;t repeat in this one. An the pitfalls were logical in my opinion when switching from enthusiastic ID students to medical professionals.

This gives me the idea that there is a dependency of needs within a session that need to be ensured before you can pay attention to the next level. Just like Maslow&#39;s pyramid.

# 5. Experiences &amp; Reflections \&gt; Learnings

I would like to summarise my learnings into two tools that can be easily implemented in next sessions.

My own Maslow&#39;s pyramid:

Core skills of cf:

Skills that are relevant in every activity within a creative session.

1. Create safety
2. Dare to switch it up
3. Give time
4. Give ownership

# 6. Recommendations for yourself

The best recommendation that I could give myself is to do more sessions. I have already used the tools to become a more creative industrial designer. And I think getting more familiar with the sessions will allow me to switch quicker between activities depending on what the group needs at that moment in time. Just like improvisation in Jazz. It is a high goal which is not yet achieved and I think that when you can be flexible with your sessions you really master the subject.

# and for the CF staff

First of all I loved the interactivity of the course. CF is something you really learn by doing and your experience and personalities together made for a nice mix of styles from which I could pick and choose to form my own.

The thing that could improve would be the structuredness of the lectures. At times there were so many sidepaths to the main story that I lost the goal of the lecture or the lecture seemed to proceed very slowly. That said, al the anecdotes really helped so maybe schedule them in the lecture on forehand?
